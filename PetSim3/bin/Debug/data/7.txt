#Note that using a "#" in the beginning of a line indicates a comment that is ignored in the simulator
#also a line that contains no equal sign "=" may be used as a comment without using "#"
# C# languages starts indexing arrays with "0" not "1", so when counting blocks in a grid, start with "0"
#a default value means the line can be safely removed and the default value internally provided will be used

[RUN SPECS]
